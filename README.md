# ptpx-2023

The pen plotter postcard exchange (ptpx) set up by [Paul](https://paulbutler.org/) is a fantastic initiative connecting people around the world over the joy of creating and sharing. Highly encourage everyone to give it a shot.


## Inspiration
This year's exchange (my second) hit me at a time when I was experimenting with typography and also feeling very nostalgic. At the same time the quality of work y'all are creating and sharing is so good, the self-doubt starts creeping in. So I draw inspiration from lyrics like "fear in itself will use you up and break you down like you were never enough" from Blue October's Fear. Maybe mine won't be good, but I don't need to be bothered with those details, just create and have fun with it! I ended up with a collection of songs that have had some kind of meaning in my past.

## Behind-the-scenes
The layouts are all done through code with a general degree of chance involved - the amount of times a letter is drawn, how noisy it is, positioning offsets or rotations, etc. Python coding environment was [Vsketch](https://vsketch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Vpype](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) was used for optimization and fit-to-size layout utilities. [Material of language](https://github.com/aparrish/material-of-language/tree/master) was a valuable resource for the techniques I was looking to learn.

## Materials
Paper: A6 Recycled Ivory Fleck or Ivory Linen \
Colors: Posca pens provide the background color splashes \
Pens: Sakura Pigma Micron 05, Sakura Pigma Micron 03, Copic multiliner
